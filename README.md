# VtM-Maps

## Overview
While working on the maps module for my Data Analysis bootcamp, I got very excited about how easy leaflet was to use and how professional the final maps looked. It reminded me of my Vampire the Masquerade campaign. During the game, I had struggled to commuicate with my players about where locations were when using static screenshots of real maps. I decided to assemble a quick reference map based on that game, where I could easily mark key locations for players, while giving them the freedom to explore the surrounding areas. While implementing the world map markers, I realized I could also use my custom city map with leaflet and added it to the website. Finally, I decided to include additional information about the game characters in the website, as being able to check who a character is and where they are quickly could save game time that would otherwise be skimming through handwritten notes. I am pleased with the outcome and look forward to reusing this code for the next game I host.

## Future Tasks
- Finish adding character information
- Add another section for other map resources
- add a final section for misc game resources
