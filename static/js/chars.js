        history: 'Antonia is a young Brazilian who grew up on a coffee farm. The farm also had a small assortment of animals, so she not only knows coffee inside and out, but is familiar enough with pigs and chickens. She always had an interest in the stars, however, and wanted to study Astrophysics. She worked hard through high school to get a scholarship to study in Nashville and eventually even do graduate school there, as science is severely under-funded in Brazil. She met with her sire at a star gazing event. He was more interested in astrology than the hard science of space, but they found one another\'s unique take on the stars interesting and their love of the vast unknown a point of common ground. Will brought her over to make her his wife, which ended her graduate career before she got her degree.  To make matters worse, Will turned out to be a bit of the smothering type.  When Antonia demanded more space to be herself and pursue her interests alone, he took it personally and sent her off to Phoenix. She is still waiting for Will’s invitation to return so they can try to work things out.  Like adults.'

And he had the fortitude to bring her back.  Ava’s early days as a vampire were spent as the Camarilla\'s expendable errand girl.  When a blood hunt was called on a rogue Tremere, she and TimJohn managed to take down the target during the day. Because it was Tim\'s fault that she was turned, he allowed Ava to Diablerize the Tremere to become a full Kindred. When she presented her newly ascended self to the court, no one was sure what to do with her.  She had acted within what was allowed for a bloodhunt, but most of the Tremere Chantry wanted nothing to do with the Kindred that had destroyed one of their own.  Ava had little chance of fitting into Kindred Society without a mentor, and many of the elders believed bringing her death was the appropriate solution.  Leigh, the Tremere Primogen, stepped forward. If Ava could prove herself worthy of Tremere blood, Leigh promised to take on her tutelage.  Ava proved to be a more than worthy apprentice.'

Garren had planned to eventually embrace Erik, but when the call to the Gehenna Wars in the Middle East grew too strong, Garren left without doing the deed.  His final orders were that Erik would rule with Sheriff Raven supporting him until Garren returned.  Erik made some spectacularly ill informed decisions in a bid to take Anarch turf that led to Camarilla losses in territory.  Erik became a better leader, but still lacked the experience he needed to rule effectively or the advantages of a Ventrue to force he reign to be successful.  When Thaddesu and Iz join his Coterie, Erik does his best to keep both fledglings under control.  He gains Thaddeus’ trust for a while, but quickly loses Iz’s.  Erik was almost killed when Kim Su-Jeong came to Hartstone to usurp the Princedom, but Thaddeus stepped up and agreed to blood bond Erik into a “proper Ghoul.”  Erik’s attempts to remove Kim from Hartstone led him to being blood bonded to the Anarch Baron Noah instead.  When Kim was finally taken down, Erik called in a favor from Iz’s sire, Zikri, to help him steal Kim’s blood to become a Ventrue.  Erik them proceeded to Diablerize her, which broke the blood bond to Noah.  Raven and her Nosferatu allies were more than ready to exterminate Erik, until he traded his right to the title of Prince as a Grayson for the toleration of his existence and no-questions-asked access to Garren’s assets.  He promised that when Garren returned, Erik would take full responsibility for any actions that were taken which Garren disapproved of.'

The two struck up a friendship that eventually gave way to a marriage proposal and following embrace. Lydia moved to Phoenix with Gree, so he could take on even bigger projects, but as his Malkavian nature solidified, Gree was far more interested in building and rebuilding his own home than creating anything for the public. Lydia can no longer live with him, because Gree so particular about what he wants him home to look like—which changes constantly—that there is no way for Lydia to exist in his space without upsetting him.

This led to much teasing and harassment when Irfan was young, and he developed into a very quiet boy with a secret habit of beating his bullies into submission when no one was around to stop him. His parents send him to become a boy scout, hoping this would help him build more relationships. It didn\'t really work, but Irfan did excel at being a scout. He took up fencing and other sports to improve his control, though he could never conquer his resting tremor. Still, his academics and extensive extracurriculars were more than sufficient to land him a scholarship to an American university to study programming; a lowkey job with minimal human interaction.  Irfan was about halfway through his studies when he accidently met Zikri.  Zikri saw a ball of rage under Irfan’s mousy submission exterior and did everything he could to bring it out.  Irfan despised him, even as the two formed a blood bond that left them in an inseparable, toxic relationship for decades.  Irfan eventually learned to allow Zikri to drink from him while avoiding the drink himself to keep his head clear and his Sire satisfied.  Not that they ever stopped fighting, or the relationship ever stopped being abusive.  Together, they formed quite a duo, with Irfan focusing on taking out mortal trash to feed him hunger while Zikri takes out the immortal trash.  With Zikri now dead, Irfan is trying to pick up the pieces of his life that remain and figure out how to live without an overbearing, iron grip holding him down.'

A lot of her mortal work focused on smoke and mirror tricks, because she delighted in frightening people.  She even worked in seasonal haunted houses.  However, Lydia also had a legitimate connection to the spirit world, though nothing as strong as her fortune telling implied.  Unfortunately, her life was surrounded by tragedy.  Watching so many terrible things happen to the people around her, taught her to just shrug off bad events and accept that life is full of a lot of bad luck for everyone.  There\'s not much point in dwelling on it. It makes her overall quite cheery, even in the face of terrible events, but it also means that when life truly takes a dark turn for her, she has no ability to process it. Lydia was picked for the embrace by Sam, who also has a deep love of Halloween.  Sadly, she was a little too cheery for her wannabe-edgelord sire, so they\'ve parted ways, but she still thinks of him fondly. Lydia is a mystery novel and true crime buff. Combined with her nosiness and perceptiveness, it makes her quite the investigator.  Lydia is very good at picking out details about other people to the point that it\'s hard to know when she is deducing facts or divining them.  As things stand now, Lydia is quite happy with her life in Phoenix with her husband Gree and pseudo-adopted son Kyle.  She is a well-respected member of the Camarilla, and the only Malkavian anyone in the upper ranks wants to talk to (besides Zikri) and everyone prefers it this way.'

She knows making online communications programs is a risky business for Kindred, but she’s confident enough in her skills to believe she that her messaging app, Corvid, cannot be hacked.  As the Sheriff under Garren, she maintained the Camarilla boundaries.  However, Erik’s mistakes cost the Camarilla enormous amounts of territory to the Anarchs, and Raven has lost all respect for the Ghoul joke of a Prince.  Raven’s ambitions to lead have recently come to fruition, as Erik was forced to succeed his right to the title of Prince as a newly turned Ventrue (via Diablerie) or risk extermination.  Outside of politics, Raven has a personal interest in the homeless that congregate in the parking lot by the Prawn Pawn.  She acts as their protector and even earned herself legendary status through the urban legend of “Rags.”'

        history: 'The son of Trevor, Reese never wanted anything to do with his father\'s lifestyle. He rejected it fully, submerging himself in drugs, petty crime, and thrills. He cleaned up his act when he got involved in sports so he could stay on the team, but when his mother died, and Reese became Trevor’s primary source of easy blood, he relapsed into drugs.  However, regardless of how much the black sheep strayed, Trevor kept watch over his son. When Reese nearly died in a drunken car accident, Trevor brought him back. Reese never appreciated the favor, as all it did was land him in the hands of an abusive Ventrue he ended up blood bonded to.  Trevor pulled Reese out of that situation and got them to safety in Garren’s Camerilla.  Reese is grateful to Garren and is mostly strongly held to the group in recent years by his feelings for Corinne, but will never forgive Trevor.  With Garren absent, Reese feels more and more like he can end his father once and for all.  He just needs a little help.  Reese very much hopes that help will come from his “brother” Thaddeus, Trevor’s new research assistant, who is already very fed up with his sire.  Despite a rough introduction, Reese and Thaddeus have a solid understanding of one another and had reasonably rely on one another.  Plus, Thaddeus is dating Reese’s best friend, Todd.  Reese is not exactly happy about the situation, because he fears Thaddeus might embrace Todd, but he tries to trust Thaddeus at his word that no such thing will occur.'

In the long run, as Scarlet experienced the greater world, she found herself drawn to luxury and social power more than the wilderness and savage power that typically grips a Gangrel. She settled in Phoenix to start making a name for herself in the Camarilla and got deep into the good graces of Prince Rodriguez for her style and ferocity.  When Rodriguez was called to the Middle East, Scarlet took over the Prince’s title. She was nowhere near first in line for the job, but she was more than strong enough to take it and continues to hold it unquestioned.'

While still getting his bearings, he ran into Rowan, who wanted specialty silverware. An odd request, but Rowan paid well, so Stefan went for it.  Rowan very quicky developed feelings for Stefan and brought him over, thinking everything would be fine.  I.e. without considering to ask if Stefan liked him back. Stefan did not, but he made for a respectful childe.  He stayed in Hartstone and helped take care of Rowan with Aria for decades.  That ended when Stefan pissed off Garren by stealing Garren\’s nice things one too many times.  He was banned from Hartstone in the 1970s and has been with the Phoenix Camarilla since.

The two made a name for themselves in the Camarilla for being pushed between Princes as each decided their protégé was too ambitious for their tastes.  As far as she was concerned their ability to satisfy her without abdicating their own thrones was lacking anyway, and she was happy to move on.  When Prince Santana realized that Hartstone was being run by a Ghoul in Garren’s absence, she sent Su-Jeong to clean house and get the Hartstone Camarilla back in shape.  Kim’s reign was short lived, with her only major accomplishment being the destruction of the Hartstone Theater.  Soon after, she was Diablerized by the Ghoul she dethroned.'

        keyNote: 'WORK HARD AND occassionally play... maybe',
        history: 'Thaddeus was the second child to the Kaiser family. His father(Damien) was excited for his birth as he feared Annabella, his sister born 3 years prior, didn\'t inherit the magical aptitiude he had. Damien needed an heir. Years later, Thaddeus failed to show \'signs\' of magical potency. Damien showed little interest in his two children and kept his magical practices as secret as he could, although Thaddeus occasionally caught glimpses of strange rituals. As soon as they finished elementary school the two kids were sent off to a boarding school for the latter half of their education. Initially they kept in touch with their parents--mainly their mother, Rose. They\'d write letters, talk on the phone, and occasionally meet up for the holidays, but before long they stopped getting letters back, neither parent would answer the phone, and it became apparent they\'d moved address without telling them. Thaddeus did very well in school regardless, and when he finished he moved in with his sister who had just been accepted into the police force. He swiftly sought out higher education, intent on a career in fornesics after being inspired by his sister\'s career path. Scholarships paid for his tuition, but otherwise he relied on his sister for accommodation and the rest. He felt bad that she was paying for his living expenses, so he donated what ad revenue and donations he got from a blog he\'d started running on the side about the occult--something he\'d been fascinated in ever since seeing those strange rituals as a child. Despite being a factual person, Thaddeus always wondered if it was childish imagination or if his dad really was magic. Maybe he and his sister were shut off from the supernatural world because they weren\'t magic like him? Annabella could tell Thaddeus considered this and berated him for entertaining the thought, ranting at length about how their dad was some crazy pyscho who had cut them off from their mom and nothing justified that they were abandoned as adolescents. Thaddeus kept up the blog anyway, even going as far as researching archaeologoical techniques by recording finds in photographs and illustrations and drawing \'what could have been\'. He explored old sites that were supposedly haunted, even if they were sometimes out of bounds to the public--he made sure to keep this secret from his sister. In spite of their differences they got along most of the time. He may not have contributed much financially, but he looked after her saint bernard while she was at work and taking that beast on walks was about as difficult as doing the degree. It was a given that Thaddeus wouldn\'t be able to live with his sister forever, nor did he want to. He\'d wanted his own space for a while but the financial strain put him off. But Annabella was in a relationship with a guy named Lonnie, a Phoenix bartender, and one day they announced they wanted to get a place together, somewhere a bit bigger they could start their family. This was around the time Thaddeus got his med school doctorate, about a year ago. He got a residency doing forensic pathology in a place called Hartstone Hospital since then, but only moved out about a month ago after finally finding a place cheap enough for his budget, on account of a rumoured haunting. He\'s adopted a cat named Pumpkin to keep him company, and now that he\'s here, he\'s not holding back on his occult investigations. He\'s already done some digging into local myths and has found some suspicious reports he\'s keen to look into further. Although he doesn\'t live with her anymore, he still calls Annabella at least once a week to catch up. He misses hearing about her work day--he\'s learned a number of things about the black market from their conversations alone. She\'s only visited him once so far and that was when she was helping him move his stuff, and he last paid her a visit last weekend to catch up. Still, he\'s not keen on Lonnie\'s company. Thaddeus doesn\'t see the same charm in him Annabella does, and just sees laziness and ignorance.'

Once he realized that he had lost his ability to faith heal, he turned into an occult research fanatic. His desire to be a consensualist drinker has led to many Masquerade Violations and suspicious of him for this early carelessness has not left him even as he has grown more adept at avoiding mistakes.  He destroyed his mortal family by only being around to feed on them.  His wife eventually succumbed to cancer as he hid in his studies, hoping to find a cure.  Meanwhile, is son, Reese, grew to resent him as the absent careless father who used Reese as nothing but a resource.  When Reese got into a lethal car crash, Trevor intervened in life and death and brought Reese back as his childe.  Without the permission of the Chicago Camarilla.  Reese was immediately taken from Trevor and put into the care of a Ventrue, who emotionally abused Reese.  Desperate to finally do the right thing for once, Trevor nearly killed Reese’s mentor, tied Reese up so he could not escape, and took to the road.  After months of finding no shelter or reprieve from the ever-growing blood hunt, Trevor met Garren, who was more than happy to take him in and negotiate that the rest of the Prince involved leave Trevor alone.  While the Garren’s Coterie generally treats him well (while rolling their eyes at his stubbornness and inability to adapt to the modern era), outsider Camarilla do not trust him.  Reese still despises Trevor and looks for any excuse to torment him.  Trevor is happy enough to have his little nest of artifacts and books and do whatever Garren tells him so he can live in peace.  Trevor had hoped he had found the perfect replacement son when he sired in his new research assistant, Thaddeus.  He was wrong.  So wrong.  Thaddeus already had enough daddy issues, thanks.'

He was far more interested in the mortal child he had left behind than prophesies of Gehenna.  As such, he was drawn to follow his lineage all the way to Phoenix, where his great granddaughter, Allysia, lives.  Still, he remained loyal to the Sabbat until he discovered Irfan.  To make Irfan his childe (and keep him to himself) Zikri broke with the Sabbat and started giving intel to the Phoenix Camarilla in exchange for accepting him into the fold.  The upper layers of the Phoenix Camarilla gained a great deal of respect for Zikri, due to the headway they were able to make into former Sabbat territory using Zikri’s information. Naturally, the Anarchs would like Zikri very gone, because as the Camarilla gains ground, they have more angles to attack the Phoenix Anarchs from.  Zikri is secretly the Scourge for Phoenix, maintaining his diet by devouring Thin Bloods and the illegally embraced.  Zikri recently sired Iz after a chance meeting where Iz held the door for Zikri.  Iz then brought about his destruction.  Twice.  It worked the second time.'
