    makeHaven('Corinne', [2012, 567], 'A tiny house of that has two, questionably three rooms.  Despite its small size, Corinne is happy to be crammed into the space with her boyfriend, Kent, and her corgi, Rascal.  Mostly because she only goes there to sleep.'),
    makeHaven('Noah', [2140, 43], 'The Anarch Baron lives in the penthouse of his apartment complex, Oasis Arms.  In addition to his modernly furnished apartment, Noah has a rooftop lawn and a massive coop for his prized show chickens.'),
    makeHaven('Raven', [1630, 1490], 'Deep in the Hartstone sewer system, Raven has a jailcell vault of a haven, where she keeps her Olympic medals, a hammock, and a cage full of rats as backup food.'),
    makeHaven('Reese', [280, 1700], 'Originally, Reese lived with his best friend Todd in Oasis Arms.  Following the first attempt to rescue Allysia, Reese was banned from the complex.  After a short stint of living with Thaddeus, Reese and Todd moved into a new apartment at Saguaro.  The apartment is decently sized, has enough windows to appease Todd, and is a relatively affordable place to keep a stash of methamphetamine well hidden.'),
    makeHaven('Trevor', [2382, 1249], 'Trevor owns one of the old warehouses off the shopping district.  Here, he surrounds himself with artifacts, ancient books, tomes of magical rituals, and a CRT-screened computer that takes 30 minutes to load out of the screen saver.  He spends most of his time in the basement, where he is surrounded by his messy nest of things that he assures Thaddeus are organized.  He also has a collection of Mayan bowls.'),
    makeHaven('Izzuddin', [2013, 1318], 'Iz was gifted a dirty, concrete-floored closet of an apartment in the basement of Owl Books.  Iz slept there once.  He refuses to ever go in that forsaken place ever again.'),
    makeHaven('Thaddeus', [2641, 1149], 'A cozy cottage that was affordable.  Thaddeus soon discovered that there was an “Undercellar” filled with dead plant experiments, as well as the still-living experiment “Georgie.”   These experiments were left by Thaddeus’ dead uncle, Felix, and Felix’s partner in research, Emmitt Hartstone.  Thaddeus was not happy to discover that he was likely manipulated into moving into this house by his sire (and then made to forget it happened).  He was also unhappy to find the skeleton in the Undercellar.  He was further miffed by the ghost of Felix, who still haunted the grounds, was a very unpleasant person, and possessed Thaddeus’ boyfriend as a means to eat Doritos.'),
