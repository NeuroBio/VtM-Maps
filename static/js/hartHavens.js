    makeHaven('Corinne', [2012, 567], 'A tiny house of that has two, questionably three rooms.  Despite its small size, Corinne is happy to be crammed into the space with her boyfriend, Kent, and her corgi, Rascal.  Mostly because she only goes there to sleep.'),
    makeHaven('Noah', [2140, 43], 'The Anarch Baron lives in the penthouse of his apartment complex, Oasis Arms.  In addition to his modernly furnished apartment, Noah has a rooftop lawn and a massive coop for his prized show chickens.'),
    makeHaven('Raven', [1630, 1490], 'Deep in the Hartstone sewer system, Raven has a jailcell vault of a haven, where she keeps her Olympic medals, a hammock, and a cage full of rats as backup food.'),
    makeHaven('Reese', [280, 1700], 'Originally, Reese lived with his bets friend Todd in Oasis Arms.  Following the first attempt to rescue Allysia, Reese was banned from the complex.  After a short stint of living with Thaddeus, Reese and Todd moved into a new apartment at Saguaro.  The apartment is decently sized, has enough windows to appease Todd, and is a relatively affordable place to keep a stash of methamphetamine well hidden.'),
    makeHaven('Trevor', [2382, 1249], 'Trevor owns one of the old warehouses off the shopping district.  Here, he surrounds himself with artifacts, ancient books, tome of magical rituals, and a CRT-screened computer that takes 30 minutes to load out of the screen saver.  He spends most of his time in the basement, where he is surrounded by his messy nest of things that he assures Thaddeus are organized.  He also has a collection of Mayan bowls.'),
    makeHaven('Izzuddin', [2013, 1318], 'Iz was gifted a dirty, concrete-floored closet of an apartment in the basement of Owl Books.  Iz slept there once.  He refuses to ever go in that forsaken place ever again.'),
    makeHaven('Thaddeus', [2641, 1149], 'A cozy cottage that was affordable.  Thaddeus soon discovered that there was an “Undercellar” filled with dead plant experiments, as well as still-living experiment “Georgie,” left by his dead uncle, Felix and Felix’s partner in research, Emmitt Hartstone.  Thaddeus was not happy to discover that he was likely manipulated into moving into this house by his sire (and then made to forget it happened).  He was also unhappy to find the skeletons in the undercellar.  And the ghost of Felix, which still haunted the grounds and was a very unpleasant person.'),
